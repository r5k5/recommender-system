PMF -> does not use social information at all
SocialMF -> uses social information without calculating similarity values
SoReg -> uses social information with the help local similarity values
SoRS -> uses social information with the help of global reputation and local similarity values

socialMF and average based SoReg are almost similar. The only difference is that average based SoReg multiplies
similarity values with the latent vectors of neighbours whereas socialMF does not multiply the similarity values.


The average based SoReg model imposes a social regularization
term to constrain user uiâ€™s taste with the average taste
of his/her friends. However, this approach is insensitive to
those users whose friends have diverse tastes. Hence in order to tackle
this problem individual based SoReg model is used.
